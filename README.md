# Playable 914

This adds a brand new SCP to the game called SCP-914. 914 is a neutral SCP, so they can choose to side with any role, whether by only upgrading items for certain teams, or taking up the offensive and dampening the numbers of their opposition. But be careful! The machine is very old, and using it too much just might kill it!

Here's how it works:
* A player can randomly spawn as 914 (if configured). Or, the first player to walk in can become SCP-914 (also if configured).
* SCP-914 presses the button. No one else presses the button!
* SCP-914 cannot change the knob to different settings. Other players have to do it for them. Everytime the knob is turned, their health goes down.
* They can be confined to the SCP-914 room (if configured).
* If they go in on rough, they'll become the role of the last player who turned the knob. This includes SCPs (if configured).
* Yes 914 can shoot people (but only in 914).

**IMPORTANT** By default, this plugin won't do anything. You either have to configure it or set a player to 914 manually. You can configure it to either spawn players in randomly (using a spawn chance) or to make the first player who steps into the SCP-914 room turn into SCP-914.

I have no plans to maintain this. If someone else wants to do so, feel free to! I honestly don't remember writing this plugin, but I felt it would be a tragedy not to upload it somewhere. When I made this, I tried to make it pretty configurable and balanced, and I think it does a good job of that. I can't say whether it's a good idea, but it's without a doubt extremely funny!
